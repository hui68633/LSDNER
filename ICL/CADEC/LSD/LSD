The ADR label refers to adverse drug reactions, which are unintended and harmful responses to medications occurring at normal doses. It includes attributes such as symptom name, severity, onset time, and affected body part. The behavioral characteristics involve the manifestation and progression of the reaction in response to drug exposure. The relational characteristics capture how the ADR is associated with a specific drug, individual (Person), genetic factors (DNA), and other related symptoms or conditions.
